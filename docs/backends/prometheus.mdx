## Enabling Remote Write in Prometheus

Currently, Odigos supports Prometheus via the Remote Write API.
In order to enable remote write in Prometheus, set [the following feature flag](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#remote-write-receiver).

## Configuring the Prometheus Backend

Once the remote write API is enabled, you can configure the Prometheus backend in the Odigos UI.
Enter the URL of the Prometheus server and give a name to the backend.
